      "text": "Well... the very first step to get this essence is by finding a Sniffer. Might take hours or even minutes! But usually these creatures can find some of these flowers or their seeds. If you have something to grow and duplicate these it will save tons of time, why would I say and write this? Well, you're going to take that poor plant's life! By having any type of Shears on your Main Hand and a Reinforced Bottle on your Off-Hand you will extract this flowers essence."
