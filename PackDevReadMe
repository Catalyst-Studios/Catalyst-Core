Some recipes were provided to ensure the functionality of our Entities and Block Entities
Recipe Types within the Dev Environment of our Mod.

These recipe can be disabled using mods like KubeJS or CraftTweaker without any problems and will not
cause any type of issues - So don't worry about something breaking, it is intended for pack devs to disable
these recipe if they are not useful in any way.

The Recipe Type Examples are available over our Github repository and Catalyst Core CurseForge home page.
