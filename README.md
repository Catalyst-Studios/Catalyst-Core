**Catalyst Core Mod**
-
Catalyst Core adds **end-game items, blocks, and tools** designed for Catalyst Studios Modpacks and 
any ModPack Developers out there.

If you're a PackDev looking to use anything this mod includes, we highly suggest using **KubeJS** or **CraftTweaker** as
some of our Items and Blocks don't have a vanilla recipe..

We have a special section for PackDevs in our GitHub Repository that want to use some of the recipe types Catalyst Core
has.
