**PackDevs**
-

Inside this folder, you will find every single piece of Documentation available to create your custom recipe types
from CatalystCore Mod.

CatalystCore Mod is, yet, another mod to provide PackDevs a variety of Items for their Packs, including block entities,
entities, Tools, Weapons, Armors and Blocks as well.

This mod also ships with mod Compatibility with; **Modopedia, Patchouli, Curios and Ponder**.

We also created a Config to; Toggle the spawn of our Entities, Custom Renders, Weapons, Tools, Armor, Custom Events and
Curios Item Abilities. So any unwanted thing can be toggled without causing an Exception or error within CatalystCore Mod.

And lastly, we highly suggest disabling the current recipes CatalystCore includes, they're only there to ensure our recipes
work properly on dev environment.

You're free to use this mod without asking nor crediting the Author. But would be great to see how complicated you
do these recipes!
